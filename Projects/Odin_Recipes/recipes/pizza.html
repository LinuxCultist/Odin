    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a baked dish made with a flatbread crust topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings like meats or vegetables. Originating in Italy, it’s now one of the most popular foods worldwide.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How To Make It — Step By Step Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Preheat Oven: </b>Heat to 475–500°F (245–260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it heats (30 minutes if possible).</li> <br>
        <li><b>Prepare your work surface: </b>Lightly flour or dust with cornmeal so the dough won’t stick.</li> <br>
        <li><b>Shape the dough: </b>Press the dough ball from the center outward with your fingers, stretching into a roughly 12" circle. Use a rolling pin if you prefer — leave a slightly thicker rim for the crust.</li>
        <li><b>Move to a peel or pan: </b>ransfer the stretched dough to a lightly floured pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet (or a greased baking sheet).</li> <br>
        <li><b>Top it: </b>Brush the rim with a little olive oil. Spread the sauce evenly, leaving the outer rim bare. Sprinkle mozzarella over the sauce, then arrange pepperoni slices on top. Finish with a light sprinkle of oregano if using.</li> <br>
        <li><b>Bake: </b>Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone or place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake at 475°F for about 8–12 minutes (or at 500°F for about 6–9 minutes) until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly with small brown spots.</li> <br>
        <li><b>Finish: </b>If you want extra browning, broil for 30–60 seconds watching closely. Remove when done.</li> <br>
        <li><b>Rest and slice: </b>Let the pizza rest 2–4 minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
