    <h4>How To Make It — Steb By Step Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8– or 9-inch round pan (or line the bottom with parchment).</li> <br>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li> <br>
        <li>In a larger bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy (2–3 minutes with a mixer). If using oil, simply mix the oil and sugar until combined.</li> <br>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each, then stir in the vanilla.</li> <br>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients and milk in alternating additions: start with about one-third of the dry mix, then half the milk, then another third of dry, then the rest of the milk, then the last dry. Mix only until just combined — don’t overmix.</li> <br>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.</li> <br>
        <li>Bake 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.</li> <br>
        <li>Let the cake cool in the pan 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing or frosting.</li> <br>
    </ol>
