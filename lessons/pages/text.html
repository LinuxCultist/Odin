    <h3>This is how Formatting works</h3>
    <p><em>This is the the emphasis formating</em></p>
    <p><b>This is the bold formating</b></p>
    <p><i>This is the italic formatting</i></p>
    <p><u>This is the underlining formatting</u></p>
    <p><strong>This is the strong formatting, which is no different from the bold formatting</strong></p>

    <p>In general formatting is just a way to change certain parts of text in your paragraph to emphasis or highlight certain messaging.
        bad way to explain this, but it's whatever, I haven't been writing very often and have been becoming stupid. Since I don't read..
