    <h4>A Mini Practice Lesson on Images and Links</h4>

    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About the Odin Project</a>

    <h3>Things We learned</h3>
<p><b>the A tag: </b> is an HTML element that's used to link images, links, and different file types.</p>
<p>the A element is a container tag, that you must specify a link to add; otherwise it will just look like plain text.
    <br>By default, when you add the link it will keep you on the same page (meaing when you click on the link, it won't take you
into a new page. you must add the "Target" attribute, and specify it to blank to take you into a new link <br>
and for security, you shuold generally also add the "Rel" Attribute and set it to "noopener" - this is so the website
link that you go to doesn't know where the traffic is coming from.. as this could be used for phsing attacks..</p>
